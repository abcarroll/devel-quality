# Develop QA-Quality

This is a temporary placeholder.  Much more to come.

Currently, the following in the works:

 - Standardizing conf files across most tools (phpstan, psalm, etc)
 - Easily keep routines/scripts/tasks/code standard configurations for projects and your own personal setups versioned
 and standardized, auto-loaded.
 - Remove vendor-prefixes for several annotations, standardize them (e.g. `@assert` instead of `@psalm-assert`).
 -  Much more.
